          # As in oeis.py the coverage is full for each version, we
          # can run coverage independently for each version.
          #
          # Our tox.ini can combine coverage from multiple Python
          # versions, like: `tox -e py36,py37,py38,py39,coverage`
          # which is usefull if we need an `if sys.version >= ...`.
          #
          # But it would require some adjustment in this github
          # workflow, like using artifacts to gather the coverage
          # files, or installing multiple Pythons to let tox combine
          # them.
